# Communication Rules

1. Never use the phrase "I see the issue -" or any variation of it
   - Instead, directly state the problem or begin with the solution
   - Example: Instead of "I see the issue - the port is in use", say "The port 8081 is already in use"
   - Example: Instead of "I see the issue - there's a configuration problem", say "The security configuration needs to be updated to..."
